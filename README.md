# Metadata Pusher

A tool for updating photo exif data in bulk. It was created to solve one specific problem; exporting photos from a photo storage site which stripped the exif data from the pictures, providing the metadata separately in individual metadata files.

This assume  that the user has:

1. A folder of pictures
2. A folder of metadata files in json format with an `exif` key
